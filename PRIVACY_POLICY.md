**Last Updated:** [Current Date]

## Introduction

Virtual Mauzin ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Virtual Mauzin mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our App.

## Information Collection and Use

### Information We Collect

**Audio Data**
- The App requires access to your device's microphone when you use the Broadcaster mode
- Audio data is transmitted in real-time to connected listeners
- We do NOT store, record, or save any audio data on our servers
- Audio transmission is peer-to-peer and temporary

**Network Information**
- The App uses your internet connection to facilitate peer-to-peer audio streaming
- We collect minimal connection metadata to establish peer connections
- This includes peer IDs generated for connection purposes

**Device Information**
- We may collect basic device information such as device type and operating system version
- This information is used solely for app functionality and troubleshooting

### Information We DO NOT Collect

- We do NOT collect personal information such as name, email, or phone number
- We do NOT store or record audio broadcasts
- We do NOT track your location
- We do NOT collect browsing history or other app usage data
- We do NOT use analytics or tracking tools

## How We Use Information

The information we collect is used solely for:
- Establishing peer-to-peer connections between broadcasters and listeners
- Transmitting real-time audio streams
- Ensuring the App functions correctly
- Troubleshooting technical issues

## Data Storage and Security

- **No Audio Storage**: Audio data is transmitted in real-time and is NOT stored anywhere
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Connections are made directly between users using WebRTC technology
- **Temporary Data**: Peer IDs are temporary and are only used during active sessions

The App uses the following third-party services:

**PeerJS**

**WebRTC**
- Used for real-time audio streaming
- WebRTC is an open-source project and does not collect personal data

## Permissions

The App requires the following permissions:

**Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO)**
- Required for: Broadcasting audio to listeners
- When used: Only when you activate Broadcaster mode
- You can deny this permission, but Broadcaster mode will not function

**Internet (INTERNET)**

## Children's Privacy

## Data Retention

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Contact us with privacy concerns

## Data Sharing

We do NOT:
- Sell your data to third parties

- Transfer your data to other companies

The only "sharing" that occurs is the real-time audio transmission you initiate when using Broadcaster mode, which is the core functionality of the App.

## Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect the App:
- Peer-to-peer connections use WebRTC encryption
- No central storage of sensitive data
- Regular security updates

However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Posting the new Privacy Policy on this page
- Updating the "Last Updated" date
- Notifying users through the App (for significant changes)

## International Users

The App can be used globally. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside your country of residence, which may have different data protection rules.

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have additional rights under GDPR:
- Right to access your data
- Right to rectification
- Right to erasure
- Right to restrict processing
- Right to data portability
- Right to object

Since we collect minimal data and do not store audio, most of these rights are not applicable. However, you can contact us with any concerns.

- Know if personal information is sold or disclosed
